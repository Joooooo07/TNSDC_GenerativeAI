PROJECT TITLE: Adversarial Training for robustness in speech emotion recognition with CNN.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Speech is a fundamental mode of human communication, 
carrying not only semantic content but also rich emotional cues.
In this project I took Speech emotion recognition using CNN(Convolutional Neural Network). Understanding and recognizing emotions from speech can greatly enhance human-computer interaction, ranging from customer service applications to mental health monitoring systems.
PROJECT OVERVIEW
                 It Introduce the project's aim to develop a system capable of recognizing emotions from speech signals. Highlight the significance of speech emotion recognition in improving human-computer interaction, mental health assessment, and other applications.
SOLUTION AND ITS VALUE PROPOSITION
         The solution for a speech emotion recognition project entails the development of a sophisticated system capable of accurately detecting and interpreting emotions conveyed through speech. 
MODELLING
            Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a dataset of speech samples labeled with corresponding emotion categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry). Preprocess the audio data, which may include tasks such as noise removal, normalization, and feature extraction.
             Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed audio data. Common features used in speech emotion recognition include Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectral features, prosodic features (e.g., pitch, intensity), and statistical features.
In this project I took Speech emotion recognition using CNN(Convolutional Neural Network). Understanding and recognizing emotions from speech can greatly enhance human-computer interaction, ranging from customer service applications to mental health .
              Model Selection: Particularly, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for learning representations from audio data.
CONCLUSION
      In this study, we developed a speech emotion recognition system using methodology or model used, e.g., deep learning techniques such as Convolutional neural networks (CNNs).Our primary goal was to accurately classify emotions from speech data into predefined categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutral.
